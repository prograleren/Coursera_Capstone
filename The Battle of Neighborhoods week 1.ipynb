    "I am a student in the Netherlands studying Finance & Control. \n",
    "This made me discover the stock market, real estate and how to manage your money. A while ago I found a tv show million dollar listing New York. Although I do not particularly enjoy the drama I do love the way these real estate agents sell real estate. I do always think that they can offer more perspective of the area and shops outside of the itself house. Thats why I wanne make a tool that shows you more then the appartment price but also how people rate the neighborhood and how nice it is to live there. I think such a tool can help real estate agents find neighborhoods that fit better with their client.\n",

    "The problem is  that as a real estate agent it takes alot of time to find the right home for your client. This time could drastically be shorted if they used the data lsited below to cluster neighborhoods on price, venues, crime, schools, family friendly, hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 usefull for what audience \n",
    "The results can be used by real estate agents in New York to give people a more full picture of the house they want to buy or alternatives with similar neighborhoods."
